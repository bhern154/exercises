Branching Exercise

Part I

Answer the following questions:

- What git command creates a branch?

The following creates a branch: git branch new_branch
The following takes you to that branch: git checkout new_branch
The following creates a branch and takes you to it: git branch -b new_branch

- What is the difference between a fast-forward and recursive merge?

fast-forward merge occurs when there are no conflicts between the master and the branch. 

recursive merge occurs when there are conflicts due to the branch not being up-to-date with the master. These conflicts need to be sloved by a human. 

- What git command changes to another branch?

The following switches you to another branch: git checkout <branch-name>

- What git command deletes a branch?

The following deletes a branch that has been commited: git branch -d
The following deletes a branch that has not been commited: git branch -D

- How do merge conflicts happen?

Merge conflicts happen when changes have been made to both the Master and the Branch on the same files
